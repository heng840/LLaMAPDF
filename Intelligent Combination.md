1. Weighted Average for Overlapping Regions:

The idea here is to smoothly blend the outputs from overlapping chunks, giving more weight to tokens that are closer to the center of their respective chunks. Here's a more specific explanation:

- Let's say we have two overlapping chunks, A and B, with an overlap of 500 tokens.
- For each token in the overlapping region, we calculate a weight based on its position.
- The weight for tokens from chunk A decreases as we move towards the end of the chunk, while the weight for tokens from chunk B increases as we move from its start.

We can use a linear weighting function:
- Weight for token i from chunk A: w_A(i) = (500 - i) / 500
- Weight for token i from chunk B: w_B(i) = i / 500

Then, for each token position i in the overlap:
combined_token(i) = (w_A(i) * token_A(i) + w_B(i) * token_B(i)) / (w_A(i) + w_B(i))

This ensures a smooth transition between chunks, reducing abrupt changes in context or style.

2. Combiner Model for Non-Overlapping Sections:

For the sections that don't overlap, we need to ensure coherent transitions. This is where the small "combiner" model comes in. Here's a more detailed explanation of how this could work:

- We use a pre-trained language model (like BERT) and fine-tune it on a task of selecting coherent text continuations.
- At each boundary between non-overlapping chunks, we extract a small window of text (say, 100 tokens) from the end of the previous chunk and the beginning of the next chunk.
- We generate several possible transitions between these chunks (e.g., by using the language model to generate connecting sentences).
- The combiner model then scores these transitions based on coherence and selects the best one.

Here's a pseudo-code representation of this process:

```python
def combine_chunks(chunk1, chunk2, combiner_model):
    overlap_end = chunk1[-100:]  # Last 100 tokens of chunk1
    overlap_start = chunk2[:100]  # First 100 tokens of chunk2
    
    # Generate potential transitions
    transitions = generate_transitions(overlap_end, overlap_start)
    
    # Score transitions
    scores = combiner_model.score_transitions(overlap_end, transitions, overlap_start)
    
    # Select best transition
    best_transition = transitions[argmax(scores)]
    
    return chunk1 + best_transition + chunk2
```

The `combiner_model.score_transitions()` function would use the fine-tuned BERT model to assign coherence scores to each potential transition.

This approach has several advantages:
1. It maintains the original text where possible, only modifying the transitions between chunks.
2. It can handle various types of transitions, from simple conjunctions to more complex bridging sentences.
3. By using a pre-trained language model, it can leverage general language understanding to create more natural transitions.

Implementing this system would involve:
1. Creating a dataset of good and bad text transitions for fine-tuning the combiner model.
2. Implementing the weighted average function for overlapping regions.
3. Developing the transition generation and scoring system.
4. Integrating these components into the overall document processing pipeline.

This Intelligent Combination approach allows for a balance between preserving the original content and ensuring coherence across the entire processed document, even when dealing with very long texts that exceed the original model's input limit.
